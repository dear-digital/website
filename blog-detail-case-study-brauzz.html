        Cleaning, probably not your favourite thing to do. But it does form the foundation of this fascinating case! Trust me, when you‚Äôre done reading this case, cleaning products won‚Äôt ever be the same anymore üòâ 
        <br><br>
        Our story begins with the Ghentian start-up BRAUZZ., that sells ecological cleaning products. Recently, they‚Äôve even won a <u><a href="https://www.made-in.be/vlaams-brabant/brauzzz-wint-sustainable-family-award/" target="_blank">sustainability award</a></u> for their products! Founders Lowie Vercraeye, Ruben Renaer and Manush Barvar started their e-commerce business in 2020 and launched their very first product in 2021. In only one year, they managed to scale up their monthly revenue from 10.000 euros to 100.000 euros. 
        <br><br>
        How did the founders, together with dear digital, climb to 100.000 euros? We‚Äôll explain the e-commerce success of BRAUZZ. using our dear digital framework!

          TL;DR? Five quick learnings from the BRAUZZ. case
        </div>
        <p class="article-inner-para">   
        <span class="pink-dot-med"></span>   Find your product/market fit by experimenting with easy to make products
        <br>
        <span class="pink-dot-med"></span>   Make sure your content is in line with the platform you‚Äôre publishing it to
        <br>
        <span class="pink-dot-med"></span>   Perform a smoke test üòâ
        <br>
        <span class="pink-dot-med"></span>   Don‚Äôt trust your gut feeling right away, but back it with data
        <br>
        <span class="pink-dot-med"></span>   Know that market research can be quick and lean, and doesn‚Äôt have to cost a lot of money
        <br><br>
        Now the one thing that differentiates good and bad engines is <i>End-to-end thinking</i>. Thinking horizontally throughout the full journey rather than thinking in silos. 
        <br><br>
        A simple example: where is the information that a customer support officer needs? In an ideal world this person has one system where all information can be found (order number, ordered items, order status, tracking code, ‚Ä¶) but in reality this person has to find the order in Shopify, than go to the logistic software to find the tracking number to finally end up in the PostNL track and trace to find the status of the order to than personally respond to that customer in Gmail on what to do. 
        <br><br>
        Why is it that this doesn‚Äôt get a lot of attention and why is it that it‚Äôs often so badly structured at companies? We think it is because e-commerce companies will rely on agencies or freelancers who will be experts in either:        
        <br>
        <span class="pink-dot-med"></span>   Digital marketing
        <br>
        <span class="pink-dot-med"></span>   Front end development
        <br>
        <span class="pink-dot-med"></span>   Back end development
        <br><br>
        Almost none of them will have the End-to-End e-commerce journey in mind. The person who builds your back-end should completely understand:
        <br>
        <span class="pink-dot-med"></span>   How your customer journey works
        <br>
        <span class="pink-dot-med"></span>   What the difficulties are in handling the admin flows in e-commerce
        <br>
        <span class="pink-dot-med"></span>   What questions are asked most often by customers and what info is needed to solve this
        <br><br>
        But let‚Äôs face it. This almost never happens because the experts you work with will  come at it from one vertical or silo. In most cases they‚Äôll lack the experience of what it takes to successfully run a fast growing or bigger e-commerce company. And yes, that‚Äôs where we believe we make the difference with <u><a href="https://deardigital.be/" target="_blank">dear digital</a></u>. We have experts in almost all the different verticals and experience in scaling e-commerce companies to >30 million a year. 
        <br><br>
        How can you assess if your processes in place are any good? Well the best advice we can give you is to ‚ÄúGo for a digital process supported by people instead of people supported by digital processes or tools‚Äù. If you want to build a successful e-commerce brand this is one of the most important things to keep in your mind while (re)designing your workflows and processes.
        <br><br>
        This might sound complex and something that is only for big companies. But if you are ambitious you should be thinking about these things from day 1. 
        <br><br>
        From the very start you should start building your engine. Fortunately today there are systems that enable this modular thinking and building.
        Advantage with these types of systems is that you can add or remove things based on the evolving needs of your engine. But your engine will keep working even if you take out some pieces. A type of flexibility that a lot of bigger systems won‚Äôt allow.
        <br><br>
        What are the advantages of having a performing e-commerce engine?
        <br>
        <span class="pink-dot-med"></span>   First of all you will need less manpower to complete the same workload.
        <br>
        <span class="pink-dot-med"></span>   Second, the people you have can spend time on more value adding activities.
        <br>
        <span class="pink-dot-med"></span>   Thirdly, this setup will enable you to add more sales channels (marketplaces, retailers, resellers, stores, etc.) without significantly increasing your workload. 
        <br>
        <span class="pink-dot-med"></span>   To sum up, this setup will enable you to scale faster as the extra workload for additional sales via whatever channel will marginally decrease.
        <br><br>
        In whatever way you will sell, everything will go through your E-commerce Engine where most of the work is done by digital processes. So the number of sales channels or the number of sales via those channels won‚Äôt lead to a significant difference in workload. Taking away a lot of the bottlenecks in your scaling process.
        <br><br>
        All channels should be plugged in on your digital processes of the e-commerce engine. In a simple sketch it should resemble this structure:

        </div>
      <p class="article-inner-para">
        Now, can we apply this thinking to our own agency? Even though we are not an e-commerce we believe we can learn from it! That brings me to our next blogpost on how our tech stack will look from 2022 onwards.
