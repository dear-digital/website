        I hear a lot of rumbling around headless commerce these days. Platforms are popping up all around, and statements such as: “The future is headless”, are plenty.  The question remains: what should you do as a merchant? Invest in these platforms or not? If you want to know more about what headless commerce is, head back to my previous blog posts about this topic!</p>
      <div class="article-inner-heading">
        Cross the headless line
      </div>

      <p class="article-inner-para">
      This is why I want to coin the term ‘the headless line’. Just as the ‘Bill Gates line’ defines when you become a platform instead of an aggregator, the headless line defines when it makes sense to go headless.
      <br><br>
      You’re probably wondering when you ‘cross’ this headless line. Well, that’s dependent on a lot of factors, and I can’t give you a specific answer of when you should go headless 😅 A bit lame, I know, but  I’ll give you some concrete guidelines to hold on to 😉
        <br><br>
        <span class="pink-dot-med"></span>Does investing in a progressive web app make sense for your business?<br>
        <span class="pink-dot-med"></span>Do you have complex 3D models that are at the core of your business?<br>
        <span class="pink-dot-med"></span>Do you have a large team of inhouse marketeers, translators, copywriters that can handle maintaining content for all the different locales?<br>
        <span class="pink-dot-med"></span>Do you want very specific features that you don’t see often on other e-commerce sites?<br>
      <br>
     Know that this line constantly changes too. So not only is it hard to draw this line, several factors make it that this line constantly moves. Not only are platforms like Shopify taking huge steps to make their services better, creative front-end developers are at the same time finding new ways to make websites faster, more scalable and more memorable. 
      <br><br>
        Let’s just celebrate that both parties keep pushing each other forward, and take advantage of the possibilities it gives us - even though it gives us a bit of a headache figuring out which tools are right for us 😅 Remember, the goal still is to create a performing online company.
      <br><br>
        Also note that operating in a lot of different languages and/or currencies used to be huge drivers to go headless before.That’s not the case anymore, because Shopify now offers Shopify Plus, which entails those features.
      <br><br>
        Lastly, know this: the incessantly evolving nature of digital technology brings greater technical demands from the market with it, demands driven by changes in digital trends. As technology expands, new features become more commonplace and more fashionable in website design and UX. The companies that can keep up with these trends will profit from them the most. This doesn’t mean every trend is useful to everyone - even headless won’t be a must for every merchant. In the end, you’ll have to choose your battles! 
      <br><br>
        If you need help to understand if you are above or beneath ‘the headless line’ and want to zoom in on what to do next - just give me and my team a shout, as we’re very happy to help to put your resources to the best possible use! 🙌

        The theory behind headless commerce.
      </div>

      <p class="article-inner-para">
        Let’s start by defining headless commerce so that we can reason from first principles. The two most important terms if we discuss this topic are ‘front-end’ and ‘back-end’. I’ll tell you all you need to know about these two terms for now, so you’ll really understand why this headless commerce is quite the rage! 💪</p>

      <div class="article-inner-heading">
        The front-end
      </div>

      <p class="article-inner-para">
        The front-end is what the visitors see when they visit your website on all types of devices. Pages such as the homepage, contact page, blog posts, product pages, and so on - it’s all front-end. These pages are in itself built out of copy, images, videos and 3D models.
        <br><br>
      This layer is an integral part of your customer experience. The true essence of your business can be seen in this top layer. This is where you get to show off who YOU are as a brand and what sets you apart from your competition. When marketing gurus are boasting about higher conversion rates and retention percentages, chances are they’re talking about optimising your front-end.
      </p>

      <div class="article-inner-heading">
        The back-end
      </div>

      <p class="article-inner-para">
        You’re now well aware about the front-end, but what about the back-end of your website? Well, that’s where the real magic happens 🪄 You see, when front-end is all about seducing your customers to make a purchases, the back-end makes sure your customers can, in fact, make said purchases.
        <br><br>
        Your back-end ensures that customers can checkout, make a payment, that you have a database with your orders, where customers are stored and that you can deliver your orders on time.</p>

      <div class="article-inner-heading">
        Fully integrated commerce players
      </div>

      <p class="article-inner-para">
        Shopify is an example of a fully integrated commerce system, in which you can create a front-end AND a back-end. It is a SaaS company that aims to completely power your online business, from A to Z.
        <br><br>
        The advantages of using Shopify are well documented here. Their business model is to use all the resources they gathered from serving millions of merchants and make them as accessible as possible for everyone, whether you’re a small shop or a multinational giant.
        <br><br>
        The more merchants use Shopify, the more resources they can put to use to create the best commerce system. But, creating a system like that, means they need to make choices 🧐 And making those choices mean that they can’t do everything. Shopify comes with some inherent limitations to its system.
        <br><br>
        While Shopify’s back-end is widely viewed as the best in class, its front-end doesn’t have the same extensive fanbase. In fact, some people argue that there are better alternatives to Shopify built-in front end capabilities! Why’s that, you may ask? Well, in the front-end landscape, there’s so much going on all the time; different frameworks get developed and new coding languages pop up left and right. And not every shiny new thing can be (immediately) used within Shopify.  
        <br><br>
        And that’s where headless commerce comes into play. It unlinks the front-end from the back-end, so you have complete freedom in both parts. Through APIs (APIs are basically the rules on how applications communicate with each other), you can link a different front-end mechanism to the back-end. 
        <br><br>
        This means you’re no longer limited in your choices, since you can customise your front-end and back-end to your liking, and pick whatever system fits your needs the most. Alas, it’s not so easy to switch to and maintain a headless commerce 😦 It’s far from ‘one size fits all’ solution - but it might be just your size.
        <br><br>
        So, now you know what the foundation of headless commerce is. But should you go headless? And who can implement this for you? And how do you know those parties have your best interests at heart? Lots of questions, but I’ll give you lots of answers in the second and third part of this series!
       </p>
      
      <div class="article-inner-heading">
        What is composable commerce
      </div>
      
      <p class="article-inner-para">
        Composable commerce is a concept that includes headless commerce - it’s used to describe flexibility. Imagine everything is built up out of blocks, like Lego. There’s ‘clean’ blocks of code that you can connect with every other block of code. These blocks are like mini applications you can install, linked to other applications that you’re already using.
        <br><br>
        It’s quite similar to headless front-ends, as I explained earlier, and the fact that there is a lot of creativity in that sector. There’s always new ideas, new ways of doing things, and new niche micro applications are on top of the list.
        <br><br>
        Composable commerce makes use of this concept and builds up your ecommerce business out of these tiny components that are all paired together. All these components communicate over APIs and are interchangeable - so if you want to replace one component with another, you can easily do so. Pretty neat, no?
